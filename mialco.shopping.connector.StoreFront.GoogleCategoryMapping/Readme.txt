Procedure to load the google taxonomies 
The google taxonmies will be loaded from a a text file sitting with teh application 
Eventually , we will give the opportunity from the application to upload a new taxonomy file

For mapping, as a start, we may want to map the Store categories to Google Categories 1 to 1
For that, we may display only the categories mapped effectivelly to the store merchandise
We most need to use a web interface to manage teh categories updates
But also we can build an access db to do the mapping or excel
We will have 3 data sources
We may store the Google map with a local db 
Google Taxonomy
Store Categories
Map file 

Data loaded from 3 api calls
As the map updates on the client - Data is posted back to source
Once thr mapping is done, we save back the mapping file to the database

The database may be sored locally in the application 

===============
